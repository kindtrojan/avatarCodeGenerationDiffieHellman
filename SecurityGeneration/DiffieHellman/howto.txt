How to integrate the files in TTool ?
----------------------------------------

from src_and_make:
---------------------
seccomm.c and seccomm.h are put in TTool/executablecode/src

Makefile and Makefile.defs are placed in TTool/executablecode/lib/generated_src.
---------------------

from modifsToTTool:
-------------------
TaskFile.java is placed in TTool/src/main/java/avatartranslator/toexecutable.
this needs a "make ttoolnotest" 

---------------------
Load ChapApps.xml for client and server code.
------------------------------------------
Generate server app(rename and store it before generating other apps)

Generate client app, give appropriate id number(advertise_client_id(x) ).

Generate another client app, give appropriate id number( advertise_client_id(y) ) and if you wish to, you can do a start_keyexchange_initiator(x), so that the client does a DH key exchange with the client x.(make sure client x is running before starting client y)
